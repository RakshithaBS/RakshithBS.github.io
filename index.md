## Increasing Sales : A Lead Scoring Case Study

An ed-tech startup has spent massive amount in customer acquistions costs, and is now looking to utlize the marketing spends efficiently. A lead is any customer who views the website/platform. A junk lead is generated when person shares the contact details but shows no interest in the product or service. The objective here is minimize the junk leads by employing Machine learning algorithms.

The task of the ML model is to predict whether the lead is an eligible or a junk lead. The project utilizes open source tools like **airflow** and **mlflow** to build pipelines for data processing, training, inference and tracking the model experiments. It leverages pycaret and pandas profilling for performing EDA and model experimentation. The focus of this project was to experiment with opensource tools available for automating Machine Learning tasks required in full-fledged MLOPS system.

## Accelerating Healthcare Data Insights: Automating Disease and Treatment Extraction from E-Prescriptions

The healthcare industry generates a vast amount of clinical text data in the form of medical records, clinical notes, e-prescriptions, and other related documents. Analyzing this text data can provide valuable insights into patient care, disease diagnosis, and treatment outcomes. However, extracting relevant information from unstructured clinical text can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, requiring trained personnel with clinical knowledge to manually review and extract the data.In the case of e-prescriptions, a data entry team manually extracts information about diseases and treatments from clinical notes, followed by a validation team to confirm the accuracy of the extracted data. This process is prone to errors and can be time-consuming, requiring the team's size to scale up as the data increases. 

Automating this process can reduce man-hours, improve data accuracy, and provide valuable insights into patient care and treatment outcomes. The entire process of pre-processing, model training and inference is automated by utilizing **airflow** pipelines. The usecase requires a need of pipelines as the data generated is huge, and pielines will help to build a robust ML system.

## Personalized Product Recommendations for E-Commerce Platforms

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in the e-commerce industry as they enable online retailers to provide a personalized and efficient shopping experience for their customers. By analyzing previous purchase history, product ratings, and reviews, recommendation engines can recommend products that a user is more likely to purchase or enjoy. This personalized approach to shopping has been shown to increase customer loyalty, improve customer satisfaction, and drive sales for e-commerce businesses.

The project aims to build an end-to-end recommendation system that recommends the top 5 products to registered users. It uses an **item correlation matrix** and a **sentiment prediction model** to achieve this goal. The final system is a **Flask** application with a simple HTML interface that accepts the user's name and predicts their top 5 recommendations.

## AutoTicket: Simplifying Customer Support with Automated Ticket Classification

For financial companies, customer complaints are a critical indicator of shortcomings in their products and services. Efficiently resolving complaints is key to minimizing customer dissatisfaction and maintaining strong loyalty. However, manually evaluating and assigning tickets to relevant departments becomes increasingly challenging as the company grows and the customer base expands. 

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning system that classifies customer complaints based on the relevant products or services, enabling quick issue resolution and improved customer satisfaction. The final outcome of the project is a flask web service which acccepts an input text as json in the request and predicts the category.
