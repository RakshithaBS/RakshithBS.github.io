## Accelerating Healthcare Data Insights: Automating Disease and Treatment Extraction from E-Prescriptions

The healthcare industry generates a vast amount of clinical text data in the form of medical records, clinical notes, e-prescriptions, and other related documents. Analyzing this text data can provide valuable insights into patient care, disease diagnosis, and treatment outcomes. However, extracting relevant information from unstructured clinical text can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, requiring trained personnel with clinical knowledge to manually review and extract the data.

In the case of e-prescriptions, a data entry team manually extracts information about diseases and treatments from clinical notes, followed by a validation team to confirm the accuracy of the extracted data. This process is prone to errors and can be time-consuming, requiring the team's size to scale up as the data increases. Automating this process can reduce man-hours, improve data accuracy, and provide valuable insights into patient care and treatment outcomes.
